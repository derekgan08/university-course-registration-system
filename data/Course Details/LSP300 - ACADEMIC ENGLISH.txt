This upper-intermediate course provides students from all disciplines of study with a MUET score of 180 to 219 (Band 4) with the necessary language skills to enable them to proceed to the advanced level. The units are topical in nature and the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) revolve around the function emphasised in each unit. The grammar component is included incidentally to enable students to achieve a certain level of accuracy. The focus in the reading component is on developing reading skills and strategies using intermediate to advanced-level texts. Activities in the writing component are geared towards writing compositions, which students need to prepare them for a more challenging academic task in university. Activities in the speaking component are student-centred and thought-provoking to ensure students actually demonstrate their communication skills effectively. The focus in the listening component is on developing ways and strategies to listen effectively. Incidental teaching of grammar is integrated into the four language skills.
