Friday 10:00am-12:00pm

This course describes the foundations of software engineering including aspects of software proceses, requirements engineering, system modelling, system architecture and system design, system implementation, system testing, system maintenance and project management. The focus is on the discipline required as best practice, in the process of software development. The modelling that needs to be learned in system specification includes use cases using the UML approach. Examples of systems and case studies will be discussed to enable students to build their knowledge in system theory and application. Emphasis on real systems through software development processes using the Agile method, begins with the requirements engineering up to the project management process. Approaches to practical issues will be given to enable students to build theoretical and application knowledge in software engineering throughtheoretical description and illustration, as well as system prototype development and case studies using the UML approach.
