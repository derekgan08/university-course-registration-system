Monday 1:00pm-3:00pm

This course introduces the theories, concepts and frameworks of management and how these lead to the effective management of a modern-day organisation. Students are introduced to the rich context and approaches of the theory and practice of management and explore the four critical dimensions of planning, organising, leading and controlling within an organisation. The course examines these four dimensions at three levels: the individual, the group and the organisation and applies them to case studies and other real-world contexts. This subject also exposes the students on the various areas of business.
